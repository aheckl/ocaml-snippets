(* Task: A polynomial is represented by the list [cn;cnâˆ’1;. . . ;c2;c1;c0] of its coefficients.
Implement eval_poly : float -> float list -> float that evaluates the polynomial (2. argument) for a given x (1. argument). 
Implement derive_poly : float list -> float list that returns the first derivative of the given polynomial.  *)
